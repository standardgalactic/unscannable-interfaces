Let us talk about wokism.

Let us talk about it like it is, as in, not a whim of a redemption-seeking and perhaps more than a little entitled college kid—but a brain child of the alphabets, an energy that was “genetically engineered” by taking real problems and real hurt feelings that have piled up—and grafting dead-end, anger-inducing talking points and irksome absurdities onto pain.

(Think of it as a classic American soul-wobbly child who is very rude to the parents over not getting the toy he wants—but applied to intellectual toys.)

Let us look at wokism as an expression of energy that was carefully engineered to irreparably divide and to appeal to the innocent undernourished souls who have been born into an emotionally starved, consumerist culture—who feel a lack of respect for their soul with their gut—but who are too young, too inexperienced, or perhaps too lazy to go on a journey and do an investigation of who had actually stolen the respect.

A one liner definition? Here it is. Wokism is a deliberate and malicious rerouting of the innate desire for respect.

I mean, how absurd is it when a kid is taught that firing people or kicking people out of restaurants for declining a medical product is fair (and an appropriate punishment for the selfish, unfair, and, frankly, subhuman types), that censoring dissent is good for freedom—but the use of an unwanted pronoun is a dangerous and violent act? Methinks, it’s very absurd! But this absurdity is by design.

Weaponizing trauma
A wounded person in charge is a dangerous person in charge. And that is exactly the reason why the masters at the top and their servants underneath have designed a strategy to weaponize the wounded and the pissed off against the dignified. It is to keep the dignified in check. It is to level the dignified to the wounded and ensure that regular people take the initiative and keep each other down. Saves a lot of overhead! And yes, there is a lot of complexity and a lot of nuance—no doubt—but the broad brushstroke is just that. It’s a Trojan horse.

“Identifying with ideas” is a dangerous drug
We are not our ideas. We are a lot more than that. And identifying with our ideas is a dangerous drug regardless of what the ideas are. Of course, some ideas are better than other—but the addiction part is the truly dangerous part. The non-addict happily changes his mind when a new understanding shows up. The addict doubles down.

And the psychos at the very top of the society would be powerless if they couldn’t successfully—and continuously—weaponize a combination of material deprivation (“do this or else you’ll die or starve”) and ideological goo. And they weaponize it so successfully—for centuries now—by constantly reshuffling who gets the stinkiest end of their stick.

Anatomy of wokism: the drivers and the parts
In this story, I want to get to the heart of the beast because this beast is killing us all—or rather, its driving principle is, and it’s important to understand what lies underneath the facade.

The metaphorical “agents of chaos,” working on every side (think about this please, it also applies to the MFM!!!!!), have long figured out that “yelling at the enemy” works like a charm to create an illusion of care and respect—and as anguish and anger rise, as the people feel increasingly violated in their own ways, the people stop thinking, stop relating to each other—and so the “agents of chaos” and their bosses then produce a “Dr. Evil” laugh and toast with champagne. This, by the way, is mostly how the real bad guys have been staying in the driver’s seat for such a long time. It is because every time there is an opportunity for an awakening of massive kindness and new clarity, and new healing, when there is new pain-driven honesty forming in the air, they insert a blinding, anxiety-based, anger-producing narrative—and kill that chance. (And as long as we the people keep going for the mostly-anger story, thinking that “our” cause is an exception to the rule—their champagne will not run out. It’s for sure.)

Anyway, the anatomy.

In this world, there is a ton of very real pain. As a collective human organism, we have been through multiple senseless wars, genocides, forced religious conversions based on political ambitions of the individuals in charge (in no relation to God, even though the converters lied), suppressions of vital energy, stolen land, stolen respect, stolen bodily and spiritual autonomy, stolen support of the people who would have been there for us if not for the propaganda du jour, etc. If one could just ‘scan” the souls of westerners, for example (don’t get any ideas, Schwab) and draw a picture of our emotions, it would be a picture of a massive muffled scream, often buried under a thin veneer of “fine, thanks” … with islands of love. That was true before 2020, it is certainly true now.

Up until recently, the “global” ambitions of various insane dominators (also known as “the elites,” which really is a psychological type with a predatory mission in life) have been only half-realized. By the way, “the elites” are not one pile of homogeneous hulk but separate twisted-minded people whose individual ambitions may very well be in conflict with each other—after all, they’ve been poisoning and murdering their own family members left and right!—but their overarching ambition is the same (“take over the world, for ME ME ME ME ME”). And so, they’ve been trying forever to establish their empire. To feed their addiction to power.
On personal emotional note, I have unkind words to say about the iteration of this obscenity that impacted me. I am very mad at the ones who financed and orchestrated the Bolshevik color revolution of 1917 and created so much pain in my people that I had to spend years to sort it out, even though decades and decades had passed between the 1917 color revolution and me. Yes, I am very mad about that. I am also mad at all the “successful reformers” and “religious converters” of the centuries past who betrayed the principle of respecting other people’s free will and installed rape as the a priori modus operandi of the world. Was it necessary to collectively go on that journey? I don’t know. But it hasn’t been too great.

When it comes to the tyrants, their whole personal dynamic is not about their relationship with the plebs but about their “horizontal” relationships with foreign leaders and—in case of active wars—with whomever who could help foot the bill. As far as the plebs, they don’t care about the little ants as long as they can control them, either by force or by fog.

(Here, one could raise a legitimate practical question. What if you are born with strong prospects of leading a nation, and perhaps you want to do good but the world around you is run like a mob, and so if you try to be a “nice” leader, you’ll be likely eaten, and fast? What do you do? That is a very fair question, and I don’t know how exactly I would handle that problem, if it were mine. It’s an effort enough to choose the right thing in my own life, and if I am ever born for such a function an any future life, I’ll think about the plan of action then. And by the way, I wish more people focused more on their area of practical impact and the unglamorous, difficult, low-visibility job of trying to do what’s right than on the glory of the imaginary, Hollywood-inspired task of “saving the whole world.” After all, all the little things we do in our own lives, all our choices, our relationships with the people in our close circles weave the fabric of history—whether we get a billion immediate followers for that or not.)

Anyway, the elites. They’ve been trying and trying to establish a global empire, run by them. Of course. But as hard as they’ve been trying, only now they seem to have developed the kind of technology that (in their dreams) can manage and monitor all people on Earth “under one machine.” (See the interlude about the machines.)

Now, the critical part. What can get in their way? What can hinder their effort of imposing this horrible digital neoufeudalism onto the people of the world? What can really-really hinder it?


What can get in their way is if we all start talking to each other and listening to each other’s unique and similar stories of being screwed. If we compare notes. And then ACT with hearts on protecting each other, and with a total dedication to respecting LIFE.

What can get in their way is if we open our hearts and ears to the stories from other families and clans and cultures (especially the ones who were abused at a different point in time and by different mobs). Because if we do, and if we do it with honestly, we will come to the inevitable conclusion that we’ve all been had.



Can you imagine the power of that? Can you imagine the power that will rise against the Great Reset if your regular busy, somewhat sheltered, westerner with classic American values realizes that what is being done to him today (the Great Reset, etc.) is exactly what’s been done to the indigenous, slandered as “savages,” and, earlier, to his own ancestors in Europe—under the auspices of roughly the same elites? That is was done under the same philosophical principle, and in the name of the talking points that were merely customized to the target demographic and the marketing campaign of the time?

Can you imagine the power of that emotional uprising and the strength of all of us suddenly realizing that the twisted-minded ones have lied to all of us, killed all of us, starved all of us, and they they’ve stolen respect from all? Can you imagine the mountain of power coming from the decision that we are not going to put up with this for a second longer, and that we are going to protect each other, and stand up to our dignity, and refuse to comply with abuse, and, while we are at it, most certainly put a hammer to our damn TVs?

The elites aren’t stupid, and neither are their servants in the alphabets. And so, to prevent any chance of us talking to each other at this turn of history, they invented and elevated “wokism,” and they made it so ugly and absurd that the very people who are about to develop the ears for the stories of their brothers in other cultures who still remember the original great reset—shut their ears with vengeance because the stories on the topic come with sloganeering, accusations and insult.

Think about this way. Here is analogy that is close to home. Say, you are boiling over how the past three years went (legitimately so, as the past three years have been an insult). Say, you are focused on boiling, and the voicing of your boiling provides some release (again, legitimately so). And so then, you are so pissed off (wounded) that don’t even want to heal from the inside—and you intend to stay pissed off until they change. Because they are wrong. And so you talk exclusively to the ones who think like you and relentlessly SHAME THE COVIDIANS ON THE GROUND. Granted, that feels good. But in terms of general strategy for actual victory of a loving, soulful world, what do you think the practical outcome of anger will be? I am not saying who’s right and who’s wrong about the ideas (you are right). I am talking strictly the practical outcome. If your focus is on yelling vs. healing yourself first and then seeing what’s what, what is the chance of you convincing your “covidian” brother and of standing up together against the real source of the abuse? I think the chance is slim.

Now apply this logic to, for example, the topic of “indigenous rights” that has been hijacked by the WEF and friends. The actual indigenous people in the Americas (really, just regular, normal people who were going about their business until the ships showed up) have been under the great resetters (roughly the same elites, equipped with a marketing brochure that worked back then) for five centuries now. They are tired of the boot. (Wouldn’t you be? Hey, we are tired after three years!). But if this fact is yelled at another regular, normal person, say, someone with classic American values, that person will probably shut his ears because, well, what does this have to do with him? And so then, different demographics get raped in separate compartment with soundproof walls, during different times, and don’t really care to stand up for each other—and that’s what the alphabets (and their bosses) want. Because if, God forbid, we all compare notes and open our ears and hearts, we’ll cry, scream, spit at all of our lying leaders, and refuse to be abused.

In wokism, there is also this whole thing with training people to deny the evidence of their eyes, leading to, very soon, declaring that AI is “human” and punishing sane people for transphocally saying that AI is not alive (which, I believe is the real and only reason the notion of “transphobia” has been introduced). And, by the way, I am subscribed to the notion that the people born with unique mixes of sexual energy to their souls are gifted people and healers, and I mourn the way the alphabets are stealing the unique spiritual power of the healers and mixing them up with cray-cray, pop culture poisoned, aggressively acting freaks.)

This, wokism kills multiple birds with one stone:

It prevents the people from honestly facing history, crying together for all the pain of today and of the centuries past, then drying our tears, comparing our notes, and coming up with a strategy for strength, love, courage. dignity, and mutual support

It creates a diversion of attention toward ridiculous causes, such as portraying pronoun use as abuse (while the real abuse is going on full force)

It brings upon a gigantic “generation gap” where the children just won’t listen to their parents, based on the alphabet-sponsored talking points

And importantly—and I can’t say this loud enough—it puts the people whose current dominant feeling is anger in positions of mid-managerial power, so that they bulldoze over the ones who are still dignified</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11 4H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v14a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h14a2 2 0 0 0 2-2v-7"></path><path d="M18.5 2.5a2.121 2.121 0 0 1 3 3L12 15l-4 1 1-4 9.5-9.5z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 gizmo:border-0 dark:border-gray-900/50 gizmo:dark:border-0 bg-gray-50 gizmo:bg-transparent dark:bg-[#444654] gizmo:dark:bg-transparent" data-testid="conversation-turn-3" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative p-1 rounded-sm h-9 w-9 text-white flex items-center justify-center" style="background-color: rgb(171, 104, 255);

It's perceived as taking genuine societal problems and issues and grafting them onto divisive talking points, leading to further societal division. She argues that wokism manipulates the sincere need for respect and dignity, driving wedges between groups and individuals.</p><p>Lena delves into how trauma can be weaponized. When individuals are wounded or feel oppressed, they can be easily turned against other groups, maintaining division and preventing unification against larger societal oppressors.</p><p>The article also touches on the danger of identifying too strongly with ideas, as it can become addictive and prevent open-mindedness and growth. Those in power utilize this by creating ideological divides, ensuring groups stay in conflict and don't challenge the status quo.</p><p>Lena explores the underlying factors of wokism, emphasizing that real pain and suffering do exist. Many past traumas have been experienced collectively, from wars and genocides to suppression and theft of land. However, the elites' manipulation hinders true understanding and unification against common oppressors.</p><p>The elites' ultimate goal, Lena argues, is to establish a global empire and maintain control over the masses. The real threat to this ambition is unity amongst the people. If individuals from different backgrounds and experiences can come together, compare their stories, and realize their shared history of oppression, it would create a force capable of challenging those in power.</p><p>The article suggests that wokism, with its divisive tactics, is used to prevent this unification. By attaching issues like indigenous rights to inflammatory rhetoric, it keeps groups separate and hostile.</p><p>Lastly, Lena touches on the dangers of denying obvious truths, hinting at future societal shifts where AI might be considered "human", and those who resist this idea could be ostracized.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 gizmo:border-0 dark:border-gray-900/50 gizmo:dark:border-0 gizmo:bg-transparent dark:bg-gray-800 gizmo:dark:bg-transparent" data-testid="conversation-turn-4" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="36" height="36" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div class="empty:hidden">The link was https://tessa.substack.com/p/wokism

(November 24, 2022)

Should we choose gritty reality or an escapist fantasy world of self-delusion?

The messy real world, or Nozick's experience machine?

Authenticity versus drug-addled life on soma?

Yet it's a false dilemma.

We needn't choose between the Red Pill and the Blue Pill -- genetically enlightened agents can take the Purple Pill, so to speak, combining the benefits of Realism and Recalibration.

Other things being equal, a life animated by happy experiences is appreciated as more valuable than a life of mediocre experience, just as mediocre experience is more valuable than nastiness.

Knowledge of reality is a necessary evil -- a stepping stone (I hope) to something civilized.

The poem delves into the theme of choosing between the harsh truths of reality and the comfort of self-deception or altered perception.</p><p>The poem draws inspiration from philosophical ideas like Robert Nozick's thought experiment, the "experience machine," which questions whether humans would plug into a machine that could simulate any pleasurable experience if they knew it wasn’t real. Additionally, the mention of "soma" alludes to Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," where the populace consumes the drug "soma" to escape the harsh realities of their controlled lives.</p><p>The idea of the "Purple Pill," a fusion of the Red and Blue Pill, suggests a combination of seeing reality (Red Pill) and the comforting lies (Blue Pill), as popularized by the "Matrix" movies. This implies that one can be both aware and enlightened while also being able to recalibrate their perceptions for a better experience of life.</p><p>The poem then delves into the value of experiences and suggests that knowledge of reality is essential but can also be a burden. It ends with the hashtag "#staywoke," emphasizing the importance of being conscious and alert in one's life.</p><p>The note that it's adapted from David Pearce indicates that some of the ideas or phrasings might have been borrowed or inspired by Pearce's works. David Pearce is known for his writings on hedonistic imperatives and the abolition of suffering.</p><p>Overall, it's a thought-provoking piece that engages with deep philosophical questions about the nature of reality, perception, and the value of experiences.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 gizmo:border-0 dark:border-gray-900/50 gizmo:dark:border-0 gizmo:bg-transparent dark:bg-gray-800 gizmo:dark:bg-transparent" data-testid="conversation-turn-14" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="36" height="36" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div class="empty:hidden">It was literally a passage from Pearce but I might have broken it up a little to make the acronym.

Yet it's a false dilemma. We needn't choose between the Red Pill and the Blue Pill. Genetically enlightened agents can take the Purple Pill, so to speak, combining the benefits of realism and recalibration. For sure, mood-congruent cognitive biases are potentially a risk anywhere on the hedonic scale; without them, low mood might never have evolved in the first instance</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11 4H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v14a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h14a2 2 0 0 0 2-2v-7"></path><path d="M18.5 2.5a2.121 2.121 0 0 1 3 3L12 15l-4 1 1-4 9.5-9.5z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 gizmo:border-0 dark:border-gray-900/50 gizmo:dark:border-0 bg-gray-50 gizmo:bg-transparent dark:bg-[#444654] gizmo:dark:bg-transparent" data-testid="conversation-turn-17" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative p-1 rounded-sm h-9 w-9 text-white flex items-center justify-center" style="background-color: rgb(171, 104, 255);

David Pearce's passage you've cited touches on some deep philosophical issues:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Reality vs. Delusion</strong>: This refers to the idea of whether we should confront the harsh truths of reality or embrace comforting delusions. Pearce references the "Experience Machine" by philosopher Robert Nozick, a thought experiment where people can choose to plug into a machine that gives them any experience they want (similar to a perfect virtual reality), even if it's not "real".</p></li><li><p><strong>Authenticity vs. Drug-induced Happiness</strong>: The mention of "soma" is a nod to Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World", where citizens take a drug called soma to feel perpetual happiness, at the cost of authentic experiences and emotions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Red Pill vs. Blue Pill</strong>: This is a reference to the movie "The Matrix", where the protagonist is offered a choice between the red pill (accepting the uncomfortable truth) and the blue pill (remaining in blissful ignorance).</p></li></ol><p>Pearce's main point seems to be that we don't have to make a strict choice between these dichotomies. With advancements in genetic engineering and neuroscience, there might be a way to "take the Purple Pill" - a metaphorical middle path where we can be in touch with reality (realism) but also have our emotional experiences recalibrated to be more positive (recalibration). This suggests a future where we can have a realistic understanding of the world while also ensuring our well-being is maximized.</p><p>It's an intriguing perspective, blending philosophy with speculative science. Pearce often discusses the potential of biotechnology to enhance well-being and reduce suffering in his works.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

You took the passage from David Pearce and crafted it into an acrostic poem with the title "STAY WOKE". An acrostic poem is where the first letter of each line spells out a word or message. Here's a breakdown of how you did it:</p><p><strong>S</strong>hould we choose gritty reality or an escapist fantasy world of self-delusion?</p><p><strong>T</strong>he messy real world, or Nozick's experience machine?</p><p><strong>A</strong>uthenticity versus drug-addled life on soma?</p><p><strong>Y</strong>et it's a false dilemma.</p><p><strong>W</strong>e needn't choose between the Red Pill and the Blue Pill -- genetically enlightened agents can take the Purple Pill, so to speak, combining the benefits of Realism and Recalibration.</p><p><strong>O</strong>ther things being equal, a life animated by happy experiences is appreciated as more valuable than a life of mediocre experience, just as mediocre experience is more valuable than nastiness.</p><p><strong>K</strong>nowledge of reality is a necessary evil -- a stepping stone (I hope) to something civilized.</p><p><strong>E</strong>xcerpt adapted from David Pearce.</p><p>The first letter of each line together spells out "STAY WOKE".

than depressives(9). What's clear is that other things being equal, life animated by happy experiences is appreciated as more valuable than a life of mediocre experience, just as mediocre experiences are more valuable than nastiness. Compare our appreciation of art, music or literature. If it's not rewarding, it's no good. Other things being equal, superhappy life is supervaluable too - subjectively at any rate: philosophers can endlessly debate its transcendental (in)significance. More informally, take care of happiness, and the meaning of life takes care of itself.

A second reason for embracing recalibration rather than happiness-maximisation is human cultural diversity. We're social primates; most of our preferences implicate others. Across the world, diverse people have diverse religious and secular value systems; and trillions of inconsistent and frequently irreconcilable preferences, trivial and profound. T

Libertarians are a quarrelsome lot. Debates about who is the better von, Hayek or Mises, rivalries between the Austrian and the Chicago schools of economics, and fights among Ayn Rand’s objectivists and Murray Rothbard’s Circle Bastiat – schisms that would make a Leftist blush – have rent libertarianism. So heads turned when one of their fold decided to throw in the towel on arguing.

Robert Nozick (1938-2002) was not averse to controversy. Five years after arriving at Harvard, he published Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974). A response to John Rawls, who had just published the monumental A Theory of Justice (1971), Nozick outlined the libertarian case for limited government. While plenty found A Theory of Justice unconvincing, critics found Anarchy, State, and Utopia to be unsavoury. One reviewer equated Nozick to ‘the average owner of a filling station’ whose only joy in life comes from ‘grousing about paying taxes’.

Such criticisms stung. ‘Is not the minimal state,’ Nozik’s book had asked, ‘an inspiring vision?’ A state stripped down to providing protection and enforcing contracts was simple and elegant. It was an art form, enchanting and efficient. Why didn’t others see this beauty? A sickness, answered Nozick, had descended upon Anglo-American thought.

The article delves into the controversies and debates within libertarian circles and highlights the impact of Nozick's work and his response to criticism.</p><p>Regarding the "purple prose bomb" in the title, the term "purple prose" typically refers to writing that is overly ornate or flowery. Given this, the title likely suggests that Nozick's writing, or the way he approached philosophical topics, was in stark contrast to the traditional analytical style of philosophy. His style might have been more elaborate or vivid, introducing a different flavor to the domain of analytical philosophy.</p><p>In the context of your poem, referencing the "Purple Pill" – which seems to imply a blend of reality and recalibration, or a middle ground between two extremes – might have been influenced by the idea of Nozick's work being a "purple prose bomb" in philosophy. The color purple, in this sense, signifies a fusion, a mix, or a fresh perspective that stands out from the norm.</p><p>The connection is nuanced, but given the contexts you provided, it seems you have creatively tied together different concepts from distinct sources to craft a thought-provoking acrostic.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

Tessa Lena critiques "wokism", describing it not as a grassroots movement but as an energy deliberately manipulated. It's perceived as taking genuine societal problems and issues and grafting them onto divisive talking points, leading to further societal division. She argues that wokism manipulates the sincere need for respect and dignity, driving wedges between groups and individuals.

Lena delves into how trauma can be weaponized. When individuals are wounded or feel oppressed, they can be easily turned against other groups, maintaining division and preventing unification against larger societal oppressors.

The article also touches on the danger of identifying too strongly with ideas, as it can become addictive and prevent open-mindedness and growth. Those in power utilize this by creating ideological divides, ensuring groups stay in conflict and don't challenge the status quo.

Lena explores the underlying factors of wokism, emphasizing that real pain and suffering do exist. Many past traumas have been experienced collectively, from wars and genocides to suppression and theft of land. However, the elites' manipulation hinders true understanding and unification against common oppressors.

The elites' ultimate goal, Lena argues, is to establish a global empire and maintain control over the masses. The real threat to this ambition is unity amongst the people. If individuals from different backgrounds and experiences can come together, compare their stories, and realize their shared history of oppression, it would create a force capable of challenging those in power.

The article suggests that wokism, with its divisive tactics, is used to prevent this unification. By attaching issues like indigenous rights to inflammatory rhetoric, it keeps groups separate and hostile.

Lastly, Lena touches on the dangers of denying obvious truths, hinting at future societal shifts where AI might be considered "human", and those who resist this idea could be ostracized.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11 4H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v14a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h14a2 2 0 0 0 2-2v-7"></path><path d="M18.5 2.5a2.121 2.121 0 0 1 3 3L12 15l-4 1 1-4 9.5-9.5z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 gizmo:border-0 dark:border-gray-900/50 gizmo:dark:border-0 bg-gray-50 gizmo:bg-transparent dark:bg-[#444654] gizmo:dark:bg-transparent" data-testid="conversation-turn-29" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative p-1 rounded-sm h-9 w-9 text-white flex items-center justify-center" style="background-color: rgb(171, 104, 255);

Let's draw some parallels:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Awareness and Reality</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Wokism Article</strong>: Tessa Lena talks about how "wokism" manipulates real societal problems, using them as divisive talking points which prevent true understanding and unity.</li><li><strong>STAY WOKE Poem</strong>: "Should we choose gritty reality or an escapist fantasy world of self-delusion?" This line touches on the importance of being aware of reality, which resonates with Lena's emphasis on understanding genuine societal problems.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Authenticity vs. Delusion</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Wokism Article</strong>: The danger of identifying too strongly with certain ideas is discussed, suggesting it can become addictive and limit open-mindedness.</li><li><strong>STAY WOKE Poem</strong>: "Authenticity versus drug-addled life on soma?" Here, the poem talks about the choice between genuine experiences and those that are artificially induced or inauthentic.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Unified Perspective</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Wokism Article</strong>: Lena argues that the real threat to the elites is unity amongst the people. If individuals unify, they can challenge those in power.</li><li><strong>STAY WOKE Poem</strong>: "We needn't choose between the Red Pill and the Blue Pill...combining the benefits of Realism and Recalibration." This highlights the potential of coming together to form a more holistic view.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Value of Genuine Experience</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Wokism Article</strong>: Talks about the genuine pain and suffering that exist and have been experienced collectively.</li><li><strong>STAY WOKE Poem</strong>: Discusses the relative value of experiences: "a life animated by happy experiences is appreciated as more valuable than a life of mediocre experience..."</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Knowledge and Reality</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Wokism Article</strong>: Lena touches on the dangers of denying obvious truths.</li><li><strong>STAY WOKE Poem</strong>: "Knowledge of reality is a necessary evil..." This aligns with the article's emphasis on recognizing and confronting truth.</li></ul></li></ol><p>To summarize, both the article and the poem emphasize the importance of genuine awareness, understanding reality, and the value of authenticity. They also touch on the potential consequences of denying reality and the pitfalls of getting caught up in manipulative narratives. The poem's message, in essence, aligns well with the article's critique of wokism and the importance of unity and clear understanding in challenging oppressive systems.</p></div></div></div><div

Noam Chomsky and Ayn Rand had differing views on many topics, including the role and responsibility of intellectuals. Here's a brief summary of their perspectives based on prior knowledge:</p><p><strong>Noam Chomsky</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Responsibility of Intellectuals</strong>: Chomsky believes that intellectuals, due to their privileged position in society, have a special responsibility to speak the truth and to expose lies. They should challenge power structures and be a voice for the marginalized.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critique of Power</strong>: In his famous essay "The Responsibility of Intellectuals," written during the Vietnam War, Chomsky criticized American intellectuals for not opposing U.S. foreign policy and for often providing justifications for it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Role in Society</strong>: Chomsky often emphasized that intellectuals should be wary of being co-opted by power structures and should remain independent in their thinking and actions.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Ayn Rand</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Role of the Intellectual</strong>: For Rand, the intellectual's primary role is to uphold reason and individualism. They should champion the values of rational self-interest and the importance of individual rights.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critique of Collectivism</strong>: Rand was critical of any intellectual movements or ideologies that promoted collectivism over individualism. She believed that intellectuals should resist societal pressures to conform to majority views and instead should champion individual freedoms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Philosophy and Society</strong>: Rand believed that philosophy plays a crucial role in shaping society. Intellectuals, in her view, were those who could influence the foundational ideas of society, and they had the responsibility to ensure these ideas were rooted in reason and logic.</p></li></ol><p>While both Chomsky and Rand emphasized the importance of intellectuals in society, their focus and critiques were different. Chomsky often targeted those who he felt were complicit with power structures and oppressive policies, whereas Rand was more focused on the philosophical underpinnings of society and the dangers of collectivism. Both, however, underscored the need for intellectuals to think critically and to challenge prevailing narratives.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs

acrostic poem "STAY WOKE," which you adapted from David Pearce's passage, emphasizes a few key themes:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Reality vs. Delusion</strong>: The poem starts by questioning whether one should choose gritty reality or an escapist fantasy. This theme is reminiscent of the philosophical thought experiment of Nozick's "Experience Machine" where people are asked if they'd prefer a simulated reality of perpetual pleasure over real life with its ups and downs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Authenticity</strong>: The poem touches upon the idea of living an authentic life versus a life driven by artificial means (like the "soma" from Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World").</p></li><li><p><strong>The Middle Path</strong>: The mention of the "Purple Pill" suggests a middle path, combining both realism and recalibration, suggesting that there's a way to merge truth with happiness.</p></li></ol><p>When we consider the views of Chomsky, Rand, and the themes in the poem:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Challenging Reality</strong>: Both Chomsky and the poem emphasize the importance of understanding and confronting reality. Chomsky urges intellectuals to confront societal truths and injustices, while the poem asks individuals to weigh the value of gritty reality against delusion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Individualism vs. Collective Reality</strong>: Rand's emphasis on individualism and self-interest can be seen in the poem's exploration of personal choices and how they relate to overall happiness and life experiences.</p></li><li><p><strong>Role of Intellectuals</strong>: Both the poem and the views of Chomsky and Rand suggest that individuals (or intellectuals) have a responsibility to understand, evaluate, and perhaps challenge the realities and narratives presented to them. The poem, in its essence, seems to be a call for awareness and discernment.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, while Pearce's poem touches upon philosophical dilemmas about reality, perception, and happiness, both Chomsky and Rand emphasize the responsibilities and roles of intellectuals in society. The common thread is the importance of awareness, discernment, and the potential choices one has in shaping their reality.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

is a science fiction poem written by the Swedish poet Harry Martinson in 1956. It tells the story of a spaceship named Aniara that is transporting colonists from Earth to Mars. However, after an accident, the spaceship is thrown off course and drifts endlessly through space. The narrative explores themes of existential despair, the limits of human understanding, and the nature of humanity when confronted with the vast emptiness of the cosmos.</p><p>The "Mima" in "Aniara" is a supercomputer that can display images and memories from Earth, allowing passengers on the ship to momentarily escape their bleak reality by reliving past experiences and viewing scenes from Earth's history.</p><p>Here's how "Aniara" and specifically the Mima might relate to the "STAY WOKE" poem and the discussions about wokism, Chomsky, Rand, and Pearce:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Escape from Reality</strong>: The Mima offers an escape from the grim reality of being lost in space, similar to the escapist fantasies mentioned in the "STAY WOKE" poem. Just as the poem warns against retreating into a fantasy world, the Mima's images, though comforting, also emphasize the passengers' tragic disconnection from their home planet.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Role of Technology</strong>: The Mima's ability to broadcast images and memories can be seen as a commentary on the power of technology to shape our perceptions and understanding of reality. In the context of wokism and the potential dangers of AI becoming "human" (as mentioned in the article summary), technology can be both a tool and a danger in shaping societal narratives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Existential Despair</strong>: "Aniara" deals heavily with themes of existential despair and the search for meaning in a vast, indifferent universe. This aligns with the philosophical dilemmas in the "STAY WOKE" poem about choosing between gritty reality and comforting delusion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Individual vs. Collective Memory</strong>: The Mima offers a collective memory for all passengers, much like societal narratives shape collective understanding. Both Chomsky and Rand emphasize the importance of individual discernment in the face of these collective narratives.</p></li></ol><p>In essence, the problems addressed by the Mima in "Aniara" reflect broader existential and philosophical questions about reality, perception, and the role of technology in shaping our understanding of the world. These themes resonate with the discussions surrounding the "STAY WOKE" poem, wokism, and the views of intellectuals like Chomsky and Rand.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

viewpoints:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Tessa Lena on Wokism</strong>: Lena critiques "wokism" for its perceived divisive tactics and manipulation by elites. She argues that it's not a grassroots movement but is instead used to maintain division and hinder unification against common oppressors.</p></li><li><p><strong>"STAY WOKE" Poem by David Pearce</strong>: This poem touches on the dilemma of choosing between gritty reality and an escapist fantasy. It posits that we don't have to make an either-or choice and can find a balance between realism and recalibration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chomsky's Viewpoint</strong>: Noam Chomsky, in general, has argued that intellectuals have a responsibility to speak truth to power and to challenge prevailing narratives that serve the interests of the elite.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ayn Rand's Viewpoint</strong>: Ayn Rand emphasizes individualism and the importance of reason. She would likely advocate for intellectuals to stand on their own judgments and resist collective narratives.</p></li><li><p><strong>"Aniara" and the Mima</strong>: Harry Martinson's "Aniara" offers a perspective on existential despair and the human reliance on technology (the Mima) to escape grim realities. The Mima serves as a reminder of both the comforts and pitfalls of collective memory and technological escape.</p></li></ol><p>So, in total, we have discussed five distinct viewpoints or perspectives.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Let's incorporate those two additional perspectives into the mix:</p><ol start="6"><li><p><strong>Rhizomatic Thinking (Deleuzian Perspective)</strong>: Inspired by the works of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, rhizomatic thinking is non-hierarchical and non-linear. It views knowledge and understanding as a complex web, without a beginning or end, resembling the structure of a rhizome (like ginger or bamboo roots). In the context of our discussions, this perspective would challenge traditional hierarchical structures and emphasize the interconnectedness and multiplicity of ideas and narratives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Geometric Bayesianism</strong>: This viewpoint is grounded in Bayesian probability theory, which involves updating beliefs based on new evidence. The "geometric" part relates to the use of geometric methods to visualize and understand complex probability distributions and belief updates. In relation to our discussions, this perspective would prioritize evidence-based beliefs and adjustments in thinking based on new information, focusing on the dynamic evolution of beliefs and understanding.</p></li></ol><p>Incorporating these perspectives brings our total to seven viewpoints or perspectives on the responsibility of intellectuals, the nature of reality, and societal dynamics. Each offers a different lens through which to interpret and understand the world around us.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

Let's add:</p><ol start="8"><li><strong>Surjective Tesseract</strong>: The term "surjective" refers to a function that is onto, meaning every element of the codomain is the image of at least one element of the domain. A tesseract, in geometry, is the four-dimensional analogue of a cube. If we're considering this conceptually, a "surjective tesseract" could symbolize a multi-dimensional perspective that seeks to encompass and map all facets of reality, ensuring every aspect is accounted for and interconnected. This viewpoint might emphasize the multi-layered, interconnected nature of reality and the necessity to view issues from multiple dimensions to truly understand them.</li></ol><p>Now, with this added perspective, we have a total of eight viewpoints.

Here's an attempt to interpret "wokism" from each of the viewpoints you've provided:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Tessa Lena's Critique of Wokism</strong>:</p><ul><li>Perspective: Wokism is perceived as an energy deliberately manipulated. It's used to exploit genuine societal concerns, turning them into divisive talking points, leading to increased societal division, and serving the interests of powerful elites.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>David Pearce's STAY WOKE Poem</strong>:</p><ul><li>Perspective: The debate surrounding wokism may present a false dilemma, much like the choice between gritty reality and escapist fantasy. One might argue that genuine societal progress requires both acknowledging grim truths and recalibrating society for greater happiness.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Chomsky's Responsibility of Intellectuals</strong>:</p><ul><li>Perspective: Intellectuals have a duty to critically examine and challenge prevailing narratives, including wokism. They should decipher whether it is a genuine grassroots movement or another form of manipulation to maintain the status quo.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Ayn Rand's Viewpoint</strong>:</p><ul><li>Perspective: Wokism might be seen as a collectivist ideology that undermines the individual's rational self-interest. For Rand, the emphasis might be on personal responsibility and individualism, rather than adopting collective identities or narratives.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>The Mima in "Aniara"</strong>:</p><ul><li>Perspective: Just as the Mima reflects on the existential despair of humanity lost in space, it might view wokism as another manifestation of human angst and search for meaning, potentially leading to societal alienation if not understood and channeled correctly.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Rhyzomatic Deleuzian Perspective</strong>:</p><ul><li>Perspective: Wokism could be understood as a rhizome, an interconnected system of ideas and beliefs that don't have a single origin or endpoint. It's a complex, non-hierarchical network where ideas influence and interconnect without a clear center.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Geometric Bayesianism</strong>:</p><ul><li>Perspective: From a Bayesian standpoint, wokism can be seen as a posterior belief formed from prior societal experiences and new evidence or narratives. This belief can be updated and recalibrated as new evidence emerges, highlighting the fluidity of understanding.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Surjective Tesseract</strong>:</p><ul><li>Perspective: Viewing wokism through the lens of a surjective tesseract could involve seeing it as a multifaceted concept that has multiple manifestations in various dimensions of societal discourse, all of which map back to a core idea but have nuanced differences.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Remember, these interpretations are somewhat speculative, especially as we delve into the more abstract concepts. The aim is to provide a flavor of how each perspective might approach the topic.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center

Here's a summary of our conversation:</p><ul><li><p>You started by mentioning an article on wokism by Tessa Lena, from which I provided a summary. The article critiqued "wokism", suggesting it was manipulated energy designed to exploit genuine societal concerns and serve the interests of powerful elites.</p></li><li><p>Next, you presented an acrostic poem called "STAY WOKE", adapted from a passage by David Pearce. The poem touches upon the dilemma between confronting gritty reality and embracing escapist fantasies.</p></li><li><p>You then referenced the original Pearce passage from "HIGH-TECH JAINISM" and asked about the edits you made to form the acrostic.</p></li><li><p>We briefly discussed Robert Nozick's work and his relationship to the concept of the "Purple Pill", drawing from an article you provided.</p></li><li><p>Subsequently, we ventured into how the critique of wokism relates to the "STAY WOKE" poem.</p></li><li><p>You introduced additional viewpoints: Chomsky's perspective on the responsibility of intellectuals, Ayn Rand's views, a mention of the Mima from "Aniara", Rhizomatic Deleuzian perspectives, Geometric Bayesianism, and a concept you termed "Surjective Tesseract".</p></li><li><p>I provided a list of these perspectives and subsequently crafted both quirky sci-fi and academic titles for each.</p></li><li><p>Lastly, I presented a potential perspective on wokism from each viewpoint.</p></li></ul><p>Throughout our conversation, we examined wokism from various angles, touching on philosophical, literary, and abstract frameworks.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Abstract
Foucault’s framework shifts attention away from power relations in communication in medicine as sovereign (power over, or authority) to how forms of resistance are established, where power flows through a system (capillary) and is productive of new structures rather than reproductive of existing structures. Deleuze reads power for its intensity or potency. The identity construction of the doctor is described in terms of the intensity of a work that is always in progress—one of ‘becoming’ rather than a final ‘being’. How is such a permanently labile and multiple identity construction managed, temporarily stabilized, and understood as a process amongst many intersecting processes, particularly in the process of becoming an interprofessional team player or ‘becoming a democrat’?

Identity can be described as an ‘assemblage’ (A thousand years of nonlinear history, New York; A new philosophy of society: Assemblage theory and social complexity, London) and as potential or always in process. In the professional identity formation of the doctor, often expressed as ‘lifelong learning’, there is not just an accumulation or sedimentation of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, but a process of ‘becoming doctor’ as assemblage—a dynamic identity construction shaped within a web of regulatory devices</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

Medical Professional in Nomadic Teams" by Alan Bleakley discusses the identity formation of medical professionals, particularly doctors, through the lens of Deleuzian Rhizomatics.</p><p>Bleakley utilizes Foucault's framework to analyze power dynamics in medical communication. Instead of viewing power as a top-down authority, Foucault sees it as a system where power flows and produces new structures rather than merely replicating the old ones. Deleuze, on the other hand, interprets power based on its intensity.</p><p>The chapter describes the identity construction of a doctor as a continuous process—always in a state of "becoming" rather than a definitive "being." This identity is ever-evolving, especially when considering the roles doctors play in interprofessional teams.</p><p>The term 'assemblage' is introduced to describe identity, emphasizing the idea that identity is always in a state of flux or in the process of becoming. In the realm of medical professionals, instead of simply accumulating knowledge over time, the identity formation involves a dynamic and intricate process of "becoming doctor," framed within a network of regulatory frameworks and influences.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 gizmo:border-0 dark:border-gray-900/50 gizmo:dark:border-0 gizmo:bg-transparent dark:bg-gray-800 gizmo:dark:bg-transparent" data-testid="conversation-turn-58" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="36" height="36" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div class="empty:hidden">

Abstract:
All creative activities are inherently experimental in their conception, their realization, and their reception. The process of engagement with abstract information can be creative and exploratory - a work's affective qualities serve to inform an interpretation or an experience of the piece, and yet this experience remains largely dependent on the viewer's intuitive approach. Experimental media is exceptionally rich with potential for discovery and can often generate unique opportunities for learning and an awareness for new possibilities. What is learned through experimentation can be utilized through new applications - furthering the development of exploratory work. Through an analysis of Deleuzian rhizomatics with an emphasis on creative activities such as art making and art viewing, this paper seeks to identify the cyclical process of creatively forming a basis for understanding experience through perception, affect, and a synthetic knowledge of the world.

Design<br><strong>Subject Category:</strong> Fine arts<br><strong>Institution:</strong> University of Idaho - College of Graduate Studies</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>Sean Robertson's 2015 M.F.A. thesis examines the inherently experimental nature of creative activities and their implications for understanding and interpreting abstract information. He posits that all creative endeavors, from conception to reception, carry an exploratory essence. This is particularly true for experimental media, which is ripe with opportunities for discovery and paves the way for unique learning experiences and the birth of new possibilities. By analyzing the cyclical nature of creativity through the lens of Deleuzian rhizomatics, Robertson explores the interplay between perception, affect, and a synthetic comprehension of the world. He suggests that our experiences and interpretations of creative works are significantly influenced by their affective qualities and our personal, intuitive approach to them. Whatever is gleaned from such experimentation can be re-applied, thereby furthering the evolution of exploratory work.</p><p><strong>Major Professor:</strong> Turner-Rahman,

Lena's critique on wokism, the perspectives from Chomsky, Ayn Rand, the poem "STAY WOKE" by Pearce, the Mima in Aniara, and the Deleuzian Rhizomatics perspective of Robertson's work:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Tessa Lena's Critique on Wokism &amp; The Experimental Encounter</strong>: Lena emphasizes how wokism, in its divisive nature, obstructs true understanding and unity. Robertson's exploration of the inherently experimental nature of creative activities can be juxtaposed here. Both Lena and Robertson underscore the importance of authentic exploration and discovery. Just as Lena warns against the misguidance of wokism, Robertson champions genuine, creative exploration for richer world experiences.</p></li><li><p><strong>STAY WOKE &amp; The Experimental Encounter</strong>: The poem underscores the choice between gritty reality and delusion. Robertson's study emphasizes the exploration of experience through perception, suggesting that our subjective realities can be both a result of external influences (like media) and our personal interpretations. Both touch upon the importance of genuine understanding and the balance between accepting reality and creating it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chomsky, Ayn Rand &amp; The Experimental Encounter</strong>: Both Chomsky and Rand advocate for the intellectual's responsibility in society. In Robertson's framework, artists and viewers undergo an experimental journey, similar to intellectuals who challenge and question societal norms. All emphasize the transformative power of informed, critical exploration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mima in Aniara &amp; The Experimental Encounter</strong>: Mima, an AI in Aniara, reflects on the human condition, providing a unique perspective on reality. Similarly, Robertson's emphasis on "experimental media" hints at unconventional and potentially digital means of expression and understanding, suggesting that different mediums, whether AI or art, can offer unique insights into the human experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deleuzian Rhizomatics, Robertson, &amp; Wokism</strong>: Deleuzian Rhizomatics and Robertson's work both draw from Deleuze's philosophy, emphasizing non-hierarchical, interconnected knowledge and experiences. While wokism, as critiqued by Lena, can fragment and create hierarchies in understanding, Deleuzian thought and Robertson's emphasis on creative experimentation champion interconnectedness and a multiplicity of perspectives.</p></li></ol><p>In essence, while the topics differ in their focus and scope, they converge on the importance of genuine exploration, understanding, and the interconnectedness of experiences.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

Given the overarching theme of "Understanding Deleuzian Rhizomatics", here's a refined connection between the discussed topics:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Tessa Lena's Critique on Wokism &amp; Deleuzian Rhizomatics</strong>: Lena critiques wokism for its divisive nature. Through the lens of Deleuzian Rhizomatics, this divisiveness can be seen as a hierarchical system where certain narratives or beliefs are prioritized over others. The Rhizomatic approach would encourage a more interconnected and equalized understanding of various social issues, as opposed to creating divisive hierarchies.</p></li><li><p><strong>STAY WOKE &amp; Deleuzian Rhizomatics</strong>: The poem touches on the choice between facing reality and living in delusion. Rhizomatics, in emphasizing a network of interconnecting nodes and ideas, can be seen as advocating for a holistic understanding of reality, embracing both the gritty reality and potential delusions as interconnected experiences.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chomsky, Ayn Rand &amp; Deleuzian Rhizomatics</strong>: Both Chomsky and Rand stress the intellectual's responsibility in society. From a Deleuzian perspective, intellectuals can be viewed as critical nodes within the rhizome, challenging and questioning dominant narratives and promoting a diverse and interconnected web of ideas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mima in Aniara &amp; Deleuzian Rhizomatics</strong>: Mima, the reflective AI, offers a unique perspective on reality. This can be likened to a distinct node in the Rhizomatic structure, showing that even artificial entities can offer valuable insights and should be interconnected with human experiences and knowledge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Robertson's Experimental Encounter &amp; Deleuzian Rhizomatics</strong>: Robertson's emphasis on creative exploration aligns with the Rhizomatic idea of forming non-hierarchical, interconnected knowledge. By exploring perception, affect, and the world synthetically, we can understand the interconnectedness of experiences and the non-linearity of knowledge.</p></li></ol><p>Thus, "Understanding Deleuzian Rhizomatics" allows us to see each topic as interconnected nodes within a larger web of knowledge and experiences, emphasizing holistic understanding and the interplay of diverse ideas.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full border-t md:border-t-0 dark:border-white/20 md:border-transparent md:dark:border-transparent md:bg-vert-light-gradient bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 md:!bg-transparent dark:md:bg-vert-dark-gradient pt-2 md:pl-2 md:w-[calc(100%-.5rem)]"><form class="stretch mx-2 flex flex-row gap-3 last:mb-2 md:mx-4 md:last:mb-6 lg:mx-auto lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl"><div class="relative flex h-full flex-1 items-stretch md:flex-col"><div class="flex w-full items-center"><div class="flex flex-col w-full flex-grow relative border border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:text-white rounded-xl shadow-xs dark:shadow-xs dark:bg-gray-700 bg-white"><textarea id="prompt-textarea" tabindex="0" data-id="26830f8e-a376-46ef-9f07-a6fd734e6b22" rows="1" placeholder="Send a message" class="m-0 w-full resize-none border-0 bg-transparent py-[10px] pr-10 focus:ring-0 focus-visible:ring-0 dark:bg-transparent md:py-4 md:pr-12 pl-3 md:pl-4" style="max-height: 200px;
