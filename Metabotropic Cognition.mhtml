1. Embodied intelligence refers to the idea that cognition is deeply rooted in the physical interactions between an agent and its environment.

2. The active inference framework views cognition as prediction and decision-making to minimize surprise, based on internal models of the environment. 

3. The enactive approach sees cognition as embodied action guided by perception, with the embodied agent and environment mutually shaping each other. 

4. Deep history examines long-term cultural and social dynamics over many generations in human societies.

5. The emergence of States refers to the development of centralized governing institutions with monopolies on the legitimate use of force over territories.

6. Hierarchical control systems are nested feedback loops that allow coordinated, adaptive behavior at multiple interconnected scales in living systems. 

7. Structural identity and adaptive control relates to constraints placed on agents by physical and social structures, and how agents navigate and shape these structures adaptively over time.

8. Multi-scale understanding looks at adaptation across different levels from genes to ecosystems to understand complex biological systems more holistically. 

9. James C. Scott's work focuses on understanding how state formation and policies have unintended impacts by examining politics from the perspective of local populations.

10. The material structure of states concerns the technologies, infrastructure, resources and physical organization that form the basis of state power and governance.

11. Dynamics of urbanization examines the social, economic and environmental factors that drive the long-term growth and transformations of cities.

12. The role of structural constraints in collective cognition relates to how shared physical and social structures influence and enable group-level processes like decision-making.

13. A holistic approach aims to understand interconnected human systems like societies from multiple perspectives rather than isolating single factors or levels of analysis. 

14. The collective mind concept investigates how groups can exhibit cognitive capabilities through coordinated interaction between members that exceed those of individuals.

15. Urban systems look at cities as complex adaptive systems with emergent properties resulting from interactions between infrastructure, organizations, information and people flows.

16. Sociocultural niche construction explores how human cultural practices and technologies modify and construct niches that feed back to shape human evolution and ecology.

17. Theoretical foundations of cognitive science integrates insights from fields like philosophy, psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics and neuroscience to understand minds and intelligent behavior.

18. Cognitive agents are autonomous systems or artificial intelligences with internal models and goals that allow them to perceive, predict, decide and learn to navigate complex environments.

19. Predictive processing proposes that the brain functions like a hierarchical Bayesian inference machine that constructs and tests hypotheses about the world to anticipate sensory inputs. 

20. Understanding and control of societies examines how social, economic and political systems emerge from individual and group dynamics, and how these systems can be influenced or guided responsibly.

21. Anthropology of states applies anthropological methods like ethnographies to provide nuanced cultural understandings of how state institutions are experienced and navigated by local populations.  

22. Post-carbon society envisions transitions to more sustainable social and technological systems with lower dependence on fossil fuels and reduced carbon emissions.

23. Livable future focuses on changes needed to ensure healthy, fulfilling lives for both current and future generations given the environmental challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.

24. Politics of the early Anthropocene analyzes how power structures and policies have shaped—and need to address—the beginnings of the proposed new geological epoch of significant human impact on Earth systems.

25. Cultural niche transformation looks at sociocultural evolution through the lens of how human symbolic and technological innovations modify the ecological-cultural niche constructed by previous generations.

26. Self-organisation dynamics investigates emergent order in complex adaptive systems through decentralized local interactions rather than external control.

27. Evolution of cities examines the developmental trajectories and path dependencies of urban areas from their origins to contemporary megacities. 

28. Cultural evolution studies cultural inheritance and transmission between generations in human populations and how culture evolves over time through social learning, innovation and selection processes.

29. Historical anthropology applies anthropological perspectives to understand long-term historical changes in human societies, cultures and environments.

30. Ecological niche refers to the multidimensional climate, habitat, food and other factors defining the requirements of a species to survive and thrive.

31. Markov blankets formalize the idea of agency as the ability to selectively minimize uncertainty about some external states while maintaining uncertainty about others.

32. Predictability of sensorimotor flow concerns how agents can learn predictive models and expectations of how their actions relate to ensuing perceptual inputs based on embodiment.

33. Autonomous systems are machines or software capable of independently carrying out complex tasks by perceiving their environment and taking actions to meet predefined objectives. 

34. Operational closure means a system can only be fully understood through its interactions or operations within the wider context that gives it meaning, not by reducing it to its individual parts.

35. Adaptive knowledge enables cognitive abilities to flexibly adjust to new situations based on prior experience rather than following fixed responses.

36. Structural constraints are lasting patterns or regularities arising from stable social and environmental conditions that shape but do not determine human choices and outcomes.

37. Meaning in a broader system's activity describes how the function and significance of parts can only be understood in relation to the larger interacting whole they comprise. 

38. Historical context of emergence analyzes current conditions as unique outcomes of particular historical sequences or paths of social, cultural and environmental changes.

39. Collective cognition explores thinking and decision-making at the level of groups as an emergent property resulting from cooperation and coordination between constituent individuals.

40. Conceptual background provides the framing assumptions and theories that shape how a topic is approached and understood.

41. Self-creation and autopoiesis refer to how living things are recursively self-producing through their own network of producer-product relationships.

42. Cognitive robotics engineers machines equipped with sensors and processing to exhibit intelligent adaptive behaviors through self-supervised learning interaction with their surroundings.

43. Reflexive understanding of the world acknowledges the observer's role in constructing knowledge and focusing on some aspects over others based on their outlook and priorities.  

44. Adaptation and sense-making relates to a situated agent's need to develop internal models and make predictions about its world to guide successful functioning within it.

45. Interdisciplinary research integrates tools and perspectives from multiple fields to develop more comprehensive explanations of complex topics not well addressed within single disciplines.

46. Social sciences like anthropology, sociology, archaeology and economics examine cultural, social and economic phenomena using methods like ethnography, surveys, experiments and statistical analysis.

47. Post-carbon society envisions transitioning energy and social systems away from fossil fuels to reduce environmental impacts like climate change.

48. Livable future focuses on changes needed to ensure healthy, happy lives globally given environmental challenges society must overcome. 

49. The free energy principle proposes that optimal self-organization and adaptive behavior in biological systems may function to minimize uncertainty through self-imposed selection of probable model-reality relationships.

Active inference framework:
- It views the brain as performing Bayesian inference to generate hypotheses about hidden causes in the world and update beliefs based on sensory inputs. 
- The key idea is that agents try to minimize surprise and seify uncertainty by actively sampling the world to confirm their top-level predictions.
- This allows complex goal-directed behavior and learning to emerge from basic inference rules. 
- It has been applied to explain phenomena like perception, action, emotion, synaptic plasticity and even psychopathologies when priors don't match the world.
- In cognitive robotics, it allows designing agents that can learn complex tasks through self-supervised interaction.

Enactive approach to cognition: 
- It differs from computational/representational theories by not viewing cognition as just internal symbolic representations of an external world.
- Instead, it emphasizes embodied engagement and the mutual constitution of agent and environment through action.
- Meaning, concepts and truth conditions emerge from an organism's whole functioning and situated experience of the world, not abstract semantic properties.
- The environment is not a passive scene but plays an active role in patterning the relationships an organism develops.
- Cognition results from the dynamic, history-dependent interactions between brain, body, and world over time.

Structural constraints in collective cognition:
- Physical infrastructure like buildings that shape permissible interactions and flows of people/information
- Social roles, norms and institutions that structure relationships and coordinate expectations  
- Availability/scarcity of resources, which channel collective priorities and decision-making
- History/path dependencies where preceding choices limit or enable current range of options
- Environmental conditions that influence group behaviors, organization and problem-solving
- Technologies that empower or disrupt existing social patterns and open novel opportunities
- Laws and policies that formalize sanctions, property rights and social contracts between individuals</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

Active inference in cognitive robotics:
- Allowed robots like iCub to learn object properties, causal relationships and skills like tool use through self-supervised interaction.
- Used to develop goal-directed behaviors in virtual agents by minimizing prediction errors between simulated sensations and internal sensations.
- Helps humanoid robots visually explore environments, identify graspable objects and learn forward models to perform dexterous tasks.  
- Has been applied to help humanoid robots coordinate complex locomotion and treat ambulation as Bayesian inference over body configurations.
- Allows developmental robot architectures to learn behavioral repertoires and structural knowledge of their ability through autonomous play.

Enactive approach and language/communication:
- Sees language as an extension of basic sensorimotor coupling that emerges through sociocultural interaction.
- Words derive significance and truth conditions from their role in governing viable coupling in a community, not just internal representations.
- Language allows expanding cognitive domains through collectives by coordinating distributive problem-solving across brains, artifacts and landscapes. 
- Meaning is negotiated intersubjectively through communicative behaviors over ontogeny and phylogeny.
- Communication mediates mutual prediction and forms the basis for shared experiences like education, politics, art, science, etc.

Structural constraints and decision-making:  
- Physical arrangements like buildings/infrastructure can encourage or discourage certain options depending on accessibility.
- Social norms define which alternatives are believable, acceptable or taboo to consider publicly.
- Resources/incentives steer discussions toward economically advantageous outcomes.
- History/path dependencies make some changes seem natural continuations while framing deviation as disruption.  
- Power structures influence whose voices/priorities prevail in shaping the decision scenario.
- Control of information flows determines relevant factors or proposals that even enter consideration.
- Institutional roles and regulations define legitimate processes of inclusion/exclusion in collective choices.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

- The active inference framework, enactive approach and predictive processing perspective all see cognition as embodied and aim to explain how agents actively engage with their environment through perception and action.

- Structural constraints figure prominently across approaches as they shape the interactions/decisions of both individual agents and collective cognition systems based on physical/social structures.

- Historical context is important for understanding the enactive emergence of cognition as well as deep historical analysis of human societies and niche construction processes over generations. 

- Adaptive control systems, self-organization dynamics and complex systems thinking inform how order and coordination arises in both biological systems and emergent properties of urban/social systems.

- Interdisciplinary perspectives aim to holistically understand topics like human societies, autonomy, cities through integrating insights across diverse fields like cognitive science, anthropology, complexity science, etc.  

- The relationships between autonomy, cognition, culture and environmental niche are intertwined - cognitive agents actively construct knowledge/meaning, while human symbolic practices modify ecological and social niches.

- Machine autonomy and collective cognition in humans both involve navigation of structural constraints, predictive modeling and adaptive decision-making through social interaction and distributed coordination.

- Sustainability challenges like the post-carbon transition involve understanding historical trajectories, cultural evolution, social dynamics and collective prioritization/control of large technological systems.

- Common themes include emergence, embodiment, mutual constitution, path dependency, perception-action coupling, adaptation, complexity, historicity, structural influences on autonomy/intelligence.

So in many ways these topics are interlinked through their focus on adaptive distributed systems, historical emergence over time, and sophisticated goal-directed behaviors arising from physical/social situatedness.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

- Adaptive control systems operate via nested feedback loops that allow coordination across different scales (e.g. cells, organs, organism). Higher levels impose constraints/goals that lower levels must achieve.

- This hierarchical structure enables complex multicellular bodies to maintain homeostasis and functional integrity despite continual changes internally and in their environments.

- Self-organization relies on local interactions between components that are sensitive/responsive to each other and their surroundings. 

- Through distributed feedback without centralized control, patterns spontaneously emerge across populations of interacting agents. 

- Examples include flocks, swarms, neural networks, the immune system - their coordinated group behaviors are an emergent property.

- In biological systems, self-organized dynamics like gene regulation networks, metabolic pathways, embryonic development produce highly ordered forms and functions.

- Selective pressures shaped evolutionary adaptations that harness self-organization and feedback to structures bodies/brains for robust functioning.

- This allows emergent order on larger scales while retaining flexibility/adaptability on smaller scales through decentralized control.

So in summary, adaptive control systems and self-organization combine to produce the hierarchical multi-scale order we see in living things, balancing stability/coordination with adaptability/complexity.

Let me give you a concise summary:</p><p><strong>Adaptive Control Systems and Self-Organization in Biology</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Hierarchical Coordination</strong>: Adaptive control uses nested feedback loops to ensure harmony across scales (from cells to organisms). Higher tiers set goals for the lower tiers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Homeostasis &amp; Integrity</strong>: This hierarchical structure ensures stability and functionality in living organisms amidst internal and external changes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emergent Behavior</strong>: Self-organization is driven by local interactions, creating patterns without a central authority. It results in phenomena like flocking, swarming, and neural connectivity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decentralized Order</strong>: In biology, local dynamics in systems like gene regulation or embryonic development lead to highly organized structures and functions through self-organization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evolutionary Implication</strong>: Evolution has favored adaptations that utilize both feedback and self-organization, optimizing for robust functioning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scale &amp; Flexibility</strong>: Together, these systems ensure coordinated order on broader scales while enabling adaptability and complexity at more granular levels.</p></li></ol><p>In essence, living organisms exemplify a masterful integration of adaptive control and self-organization, producing multi-scale order by seamlessly weaving stability with flexibility. Through local interactions, coherent and intricate global phenomena emerge.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>Certainly! Practopoiesis is a theory about how adaptive systems, especially biological brains, organize their operations across multiple levels to generate intelligent behavior. The term "practopoiesis" is derived from "praxis" (doing, acting) and "poiesis" (creation, production), which reflects the theory's focus on action-oriented knowledge creation.</p><p>Here's a concise overview:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Multi-Level Organization</strong>: Practopoiesis posits that intelligent systems operate across multiple nested levels, where each level provides guidelines or constraints for the level below it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tries (Levels)</strong>: The theory typically describes three operational levels, known as "tries":</p><ul><li><p><strong>T1 (Anapoietic Try)</strong>: This is the lowest level and is responsible for basic operations, like neuronal activations in the brain. It deals with immediate and specific sensory inputs and motor outputs.</p></li><li><p><strong>T2 (Adapto-poietic Try)</strong>: This level adjusts the operations of T1 based on learning from experience. In the context of the brain, this could be seen as synaptic plasticity.</p></li><li><p><strong>T3 (Practopoietic Try)</strong>: The highest level, it modifies the learning mechanisms of T2 based on overarching goals or strategies. It's akin to metacognition or thinking about one's thinking and learning patterns.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Adaptive Feedback</strong>: The higher levels provide feedback to the lower levels, ensuring that the system is always tuned to its environment and can swiftly adjust to changes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Action-Oriented</strong>: Practopoiesis emphasizes that knowledge and understanding are deeply tied to action. Systems don't just passively receive information; they actively engage with and shape their environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implications for AI</strong>: The theory suggests that truly intelligent artificial systems would need to have similar multi-level, feedback-driven architectures that are geared towards action in the real world.</p></li></ol><p>In essence, practopoiesis provides a framework for understanding how complex adaptive systems, like the brain, achieve flexible, intelligent behavior through layered operations and constant feedback across these layers.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>Certainly! Let's establish connections between practopoiesis and the previously discussed topics:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Active Inference &amp; Cognitive Robotics</strong>:</p><ul><li>Both practopoiesis and active inference emphasize the importance of action and interaction with the environment.</li><li>Robots employing active inference could utilize a practopoietic architecture by adjusting sensory-motor predictions (T1) using synaptic adjustments (T2) based on overarching learning strategies (T3).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Enactive Approach to Cognition</strong>:</p><ul><li>The enactive approach's emphasis on embodied engagement aligns with the practopoietic idea that knowledge and understanding are deeply tied to action.</li><li>Both theories see cognition as an emergent phenomenon that arises from an organism's active engagement with its environment.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Structural Constraints in Collective Cognition</strong>:</p><ul><li>Practopoiesis’ hierarchical structure can be analogous to how structural constraints work in societies. The broader cultural and institutional norms (akin to T3) influence social roles and norms (akin to T2), which then affect individual actions and behaviors (akin to T1).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Adaptive Control Systems and Self-Organization</strong>:</p><ul><li>Practopoiesis can be seen as a specific kind of adaptive control system where different levels adapt based on feedback.</li><li>The theory incorporates principles of self-organization, especially at the T1 level, where local interactions lead to emergent global behaviors.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Historical Context &amp; Interdisciplinary Perspectives</strong>:</p><ul><li>Just as historical context is vital for the enactive emergence of cognition, the T3 level in practopoiesis can be influenced by past experiences and learning strategies.</li><li>Understanding practopoiesis fully may require interdisciplinary insights, blending neurobiology with systems theory, AI research, and philosophy of mind.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Machine Autonomy &amp; Collective Cognition</strong>:</p><ul><li>Machines designed with a practopoietic structure might show higher degrees of autonomy by adapting at multiple levels.</li><li>In collective human cognition, the multi-level feedback seen in practopoiesis is mirrored in how individual cognition (T1) is influenced by group dynamics and norms (T2) and broader cultural or institutional guidelines (T3).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Sustainability Challenges</strong>:</p><ul><li>The adaptability and feedback mechanisms inherent in practopoiesis might offer insights into designing sustainable systems that can adjust to changing environments and challenges over time.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Common Themes</strong>:</p><ul><li>Emergence, embodiment, adaptation, and structural influences on autonomy/intelligence all resonate with the principles of practopoiesis.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In summary, practopoiesis provides a rich theoretical framework that intersects with many of the previously discussed concepts, especially in understanding cognition as a multi-level, adaptive, and emergent phenomenon.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center

Friston's work has significantly influenced the field of theoretical neuroscience, especially in the context of predictive coding and Bayesian inference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch</strong>: Co-authors of "The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience", which is fundamental to the enactive approach to cognition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela</strong>: For their work on autopoiesis, which focuses on self-producing systems and has parallels with practopoiesis in terms of system organization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rodney Brooks</strong>: For his work in robotics, particularly his emphasis on embodied cognition and the idea that intelligence emerges from interactions with the environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ilya Prigogine</strong>: Noted for his work on self-organization, especially in the context of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stuart Kauffman</strong>: For his exploration of the concept of the "edge of chaos" and the role of self-organization in biological systems.</p></li></ol><p>If you're specifically interested in practopoiesis, starting with Danko Nikolić's papers and presentations would be the most direct route. However, the other authors provide a broader context for understanding the multi-layered, adaptive nature of cognition and how systems organize and maintain themselves.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800" data-testid="conversation-turn-18" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="36" height="36" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div class="empty:hidden">Here is a brief summary of Danko Nikolić's work and theoretical perspectives:

- Danko Nikolić is a Serbian philosopher and professor known for his work on autonomy, agency, cognition and enactive/embodied approaches.

- Much of his research applies enactive and autopoietic theories to shed new light on issues in philosophy of mind, cognitive science and AI. 

- He critiques traditional computational theories of cognition as overly representational and internalistic. 

- Instead, he advocates understanding cognition as an emergent property of autonomous agents that arise through adaptive interaction with their environments.

- Nikolić develops the concepts of "autonomous agency" - where autonomous systems actively generate and maintain their own organizational identity through sense-making within a context.

- His work draws connections between autopoiesis in living cells, cognition in embodied agents, and possible pathways for engineering artificial autonomy.

- Structural and operational closure are important ideas in Nikolić's theoretical framework - emphasizing how autonomy depends on a system's ongoing interactions within a broader domain. 

- He argues this enactive, embodied perspective provides a more empirically grounded approach to understanding the nature of life, mind, and potential routes to machine sapience.

- Overall, Nikolić makes important contributions to integrating principles of autonomy, emergence, sense-making and environmental coupling into philosophical theories of cognition and artificial intelligence.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11 4H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v14a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h14a2 2 0 0 0 2-2v-7"></path><path d="M18.5 2.5a2.121 2.121 0 0 1 3 3L12 15l-4 1 1-4 9.5-9.5z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]" data-testid="conversation-turn-19" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative p-1 rounded-sm h-9 w-9 text-white flex items-center justify-center" style="background-color: rgb(171, 104, 255);

Connecting this back to our previous discussions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Practopoiesis</strong>: Danko Nikolić's concept of practopoiesis is especially relevant as it offers a multi-level, adaptive framework for understanding cognition. This ties directly into the earlier mentioned notions of adaptive control systems and self-organization dynamics, which play crucial roles in the emergence of order and complexity in biological systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enactive Approach and Predictive Processing</strong>: As you noted, Nikolić's critique of traditional computational theories and emphasis on enactive cognition ties into the enactive approach and active inference framework we discussed. Both perspectives focus on cognition as an emergent property resulting from an agent's interaction with its environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Structural Constraints</strong>: The emphasis on "structural and operational closure" in Nikolić's work can be related to the structural constraints that influence both individual and collective cognitive processes. These constraints, whether they're physical, social, or informational, play a significant role in shaping the interactions and decisions of agents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interdisciplinary Perspectives</strong>: Danko Nikolić's work, which integrates concepts from biology, philosophy, cognitive science, and AI, underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in understanding complex phenomena.</p></li><li><p><strong>Machine Autonomy</strong>: Nikolić's insights into how the principles of autonomy, emergence, and environmental coupling might inform the development of artificial intelligence and machine sapience connect back to the topic of active inference in cognitive robotics.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, Nikolić's contributions provide a valuable perspective in the broader conversation about cognition, emergence, and the nature of intelligence, bridging gaps between biological systems and potential artificial agents.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800" data-testid="conversation-turn-20" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="36" height="36" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div class="empty:hidden">Here are some key points about practopoiesis in Danko Nikolić's work:

- Practopoiesis refers to the generation of practice or patterns of viable sensory-motor coordination through an autonomous agent's adaptive coupling with its environment.

- It is seen as a precursor to more advanced forms of cognition like representation and symbolic thought. Even basic living cells exhibit a rudimentary form of practopoiesis to uptake nutrients and maintain homeostasis.

- For Nikolić, practice or patterns of interaction are primary to theory or internal representation. An autonomous entity first structures its operational coupling with the world and only secondarily builds representations, if at all.

- Practices are genuinely productive - they shape the ontology of an autonomous system by defining its operational coherences and viable ways of engaging with its niche. 

- Through practopoiesis, cognitive boundaries and structural identity emerge for an agent as it enacts circular processes that selectively integrate some aspects of the environment within itself.

- Successful practices are retained and expanded in a process of qualitative novelty, leading to increasing homeostasis and adaptability over time through circularly-produced phenotypic changes.

- For Nikolić, practopoiesis highlights the fundamentally practical, precognitive roots of experiential domains and structural couplings that make both biological and engineered cognition possible.

- It serves as a framework for understanding the dynamics of autonomous self-generation through adaptive interaction, prior to more complex cognitive capabilities.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11 4H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v14a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h14a2 2 0 0 0 2-2v-7"></path><path d="M18.5 2.5a2.121 2.121 0 0 1 3 3L12 15l-4 1 1-4 9.5-9.5z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]" data-testid="conversation-turn-21" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative p-1 rounded-sm h-9 w-9 text-white flex items-center justify-center" style="background-color: rgb(171, 104, 255);

Given your detailed summary, let's connect Danko Nikolić's concept of practopoiesis to the previously discussed topics:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Enactive Approach and Active Inference Framework</strong>: Practopoiesis aligns with the enactive approach's emphasis on an agent's active engagement with its environment. The idea that practices are primary to theory resonates with the active inference framework's focus on how agents minimize surprise through interactions with the world, rather than just passive internal representations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Structural Constraints</strong>: Nikolić's assertion that practices shape the ontology of an autonomous system ties into the influence of structural constraints on both individual and collective cognitive processes. These practices evolve within, and are shaped by, physical, social, and informational constraints.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adaptive Control Systems and Self-organization</strong>: Practopoiesis embodies adaptive control and self-organization dynamics. Agents generate practices that maintain homeostasis and functional integrity, and these practices emerge organically without centralized control, much like self-organized systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Historical Context</strong>: The idea that successful practices are retained and expanded upon leads to an understanding of the deep historical roots of cognitive evolution, emphasizing how past interactions influence current cognitive behaviors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interdisciplinary Perspectives</strong>: Practopoiesis offers insights that resonate across fields like cognitive science, biology, and AI. It emphasizes the foundational role of adaptive interactions in both living organisms and potential artificial systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Machine Autonomy and Cognitive Robotics</strong>: By underscoring the importance of practice over representation, practopoiesis provides an avenue to approach machine learning and AI from a perspective that values adaptive interactions over mere algorithmic efficiency. This relates to how robots, like iCub, learn from self-supervised interactions.</p></li></ol><p>In essence, Danko Nikolić's concept of practopoiesis brings to the forefront the foundational importance of adaptive interactions in cognitive processes. It weaves together themes of emergence, adaptability, and the deep roots of cognition in both biological and engineered systems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800" data-testid="conversation-turn-22" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="36" height="36" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div class="empty:hidden">http://www.danko-nikolic.com/

About me
Danko Nikolić
Getting the kick out of practopoiesis.
The main motive for my studies is the explanatory gap between the brain and the mind. My interest is in how the physical world of neuronal activity produces the mental world of perception and cognition. I spent many years at the Max-Planck Institute for Brain Research, and I am currently associated with Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, and the University of Zagreb.

I approach the problem of explanatory gap from both sides, bottom-up and top-down. The bottom-up approach investigates brain physiology. The top-down approach investigates the behavior and experiences. Each of the two approaches led me to develop a theory: The work on behavior and experiences led me to discover the phenomenon of ideasthesia (meaning "sensing concepts"). The work on physiology resulted in the theory of practopoiesis (meaning "creation of actions").

The empirical work in the background of those theories involved simultaneous recordings of activity of 100+ neurons in the visual cortex (extracellular recordings), behavioral and imaging studies in visual cognition (attention, working memory, long-term memory), and empirical investigations of phenomenal experiences (synesthesia).

The ultimate goal of my studies is twofold. First, I would like to achieve conceptual understanding of how the dynamics of physical processes creates the mental ones. I believe that the work on practopoiesis presents an important step in this direction and that it will help us eventually address the hard problem of consciousness and the mind-body problem in general. Second, I would like to use this theoretical knowledge to create artificial systems that are biologically-like intelligent and adaptive (see AI-Kindergarten).

I think that this paper could turn out to be my most important contribution to neuroscience so far. Finers crossed that the proposed hypothesis turns out correct.

A reason why one would be interested in studying the brain in the first place is described here: Why brain?</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11 4H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v14a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h14a2 2 0 0 0 2-2v-7"></path><path d="M18.5 2.5a2.121 2.121 0 0 1 3 3L12 15l-4 1 1-4 9.5-9.5z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]" data-testid="conversation-turn-23" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative p-1 rounded-sm h-9 w-9 text-white flex items-center justify-center" style="background-color: rgb(171, 104, 255);

It offers a comprehensive view of his work, focus, and aspirations. Based on this information, let's draw the connections to the previously discussed topics:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Explanatory Gap and Active Inference/Enactive Approach</strong>: Nikolić's focus on bridging the explanatory gap between the brain and the mind is akin to the active inference framework and the enactive approach to cognition. Both emphasize the embodied nature of cognition and the importance of an agent's active engagement with its environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bottom-up and Top-down Approaches</strong>: The dual strategy Nikolić employs - investigating both brain physiology (bottom-up) and behavior/experiences (top-down) - reflects the comprehensive nature of studying cognitive systems. It mirrors how both internal structural constraints and external environmental interactions shape cognition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ideasthesia and Practopoiesis</strong>: While ideasthesia highlights the concept of "sensing concepts" (which can be related to the emergence of symbolic meaning in the enactive approach to language/communication), practopoiesis underscores the creation of actions. This aligns with the active inference framework, where agents actively sample their world to match top-level predictions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empirical Work</strong>: Nikolić's empirical work, particularly the simultaneous recording of neuron activity, complements the idea of adaptive control systems and self-organization. The coordinated responses and emergent behaviors in neural networks resonate with the self-organized dynamics we discussed earlier.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI-Kindergarten</strong>: Nikolić's goal to use theoretical knowledge to design biologically-like intelligent and adaptive systems is directly connected to the previous discussions on cognitive robotics and machine autonomy. His approach suggests a more holistic and biologically-inspired path for AI development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Neuroscience Contribution</strong>: The paper Nikolić references, which he believes could be a significant contribution, likely resonates with the themes of emergence, embodiment, mutual constitution, and structural influences on autonomy/intelligence.</p></li><li><p><strong>"Why brain?"</strong>: This question encapsulates the overarching connection between all topics. It emphasizes the interdisciplinary effort required to understand the brain, bridging biology, cognition, history, structure, and potentially AI.</p></li></ol><p>In conclusion, Danko Nikolić's work offers a multifaceted approach to understanding cognition, blending empirical studies with theoretical advancements, all aimed at bridging the deep mysteries of the brain and the mind. His goals and methods align seamlessly with the various topics we've explored.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800" data-testid="conversation-turn-24" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="36" height="36" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div class="empty:hidden">Ideasthesia (alternative spelling ideaesthesia) is a neuropsychological phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like sensory experiences (concurrents). The name comes from the Ancient Greek ἰδέα (idéa) and αἴσθησις (aísthēsis), meaning 'sensing concepts' or 'sensing ideas'. The notion was introduced by neuroscientist Danko Nikolić as an alternative explanation for a set of phenomena traditionally covered by synesthesia.[1]


Example of associations between graphemes and colors that are described more accurately as ideasthesia than as synesthesia
While synesthesia meaning 'union of senses' implies the association of two sensory elements with little connection to the cognitive level, empirical evidence indicated that most phenomena linked to synesthesia are in fact induced by semantic representations. That is, the linguistic meaning of the stimulus is what is important rather than its sensory properties. In other words, while synesthesia presumes that both the trigger (inducer) and the resulting experience (concurrent) are of sensory nature, ideasthesia presumes that only the resulting experience is of sensory nature while the trigger is semantic.[2][3][4][5][6][7]

Research has later extended the concept to topics other than synesthesia, and since it turned out to be applicable to everyday perception, the concept has developed into a theory of how we perceive. For example ideasthesia has been applied to the theory of art and could bear important implications in explaining human conscious experience, which, according to ideasthesia, is grounded in how we activate concepts.[8]</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 visible"><button class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">2 / 2</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11 4H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v14a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h14a2 2 0 0 0 2-2v-7"></path><path d="M18.5 2.5a2.121 2.121 0 0 1 3 3L12 15l-4 1 1-4 9.5-9.5z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]" data-testid="conversation-turn-25" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative p-1 rounded-sm h-9 w-9 text-white flex items-center justify-center" style="background-color: rgb(171, 104, 255);

To relate ideasthesia back to the previously discussed topics:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Cognition and Perception</strong>: At the heart of ideasthesia is a refined understanding of cognition. Unlike synesthesia, which focuses on a direct sensory-to-sensory correspondence, ideasthesia emphasizes the primacy of cognitive or conceptual associations in eliciting sensory experiences. This complements the active inference and enactive approach to cognition, where meaning, perception, and action are tightly interwoven.</p></li><li><p><strong>Embodied and Enactive Approaches</strong>: The idea that sensory experiences can be evoked by conceptual activations aligns with the enactive approach's emphasis on the importance of embodied interaction with the environment and the derived meanings from such interactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Structural Constraints and Decision-Making</strong>: In ideasthesia, the semantic representation or meaning of a stimulus takes precedence over its sensory properties. This can be likened to how structural constraints shape decision-making processes, where the underlying meaning or significance of information, rather than just its superficial presentation, influences choices.</p></li><li><p><strong>Language and Communication</strong>: Ideasthesia underlines how words and concepts have perceptual effects, tying into the enactive approach's perspective on language. Words derive significance not just from internal representations but from their role in shaping sensory experiences and engagements with the environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Art, Consciousness, and Perception</strong>: The application of ideasthesia to art theory and human conscious experience speaks to the broader implications of the concept. Art often blurs the lines between sensory experience and meaning, and ideasthesia provides a framework for understanding how conceptual activations play into our aesthetic and conscious experiences.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adaptive Control Systems and Self-Organization</strong>: Ideasthesia could be seen as a manifestation of the brain's adaptive control systems.

Ideasthesia is congruent with the theory of brain functioning known as practopoiesis.[34] According to that theory, concepts are not an emergent property of highly developed, specialized neuronal networks in the brain, as is usually assumed; rather, concepts are proposed to be fundamental to the very adaptive principles by which living systems and the brain operate.[35]

A study using magnetoencephalography has shown that color information is available in the brain signal ~200 milliseconds later when accessed via synesthesia in comparison to direct color perception, which is consistent with conceptual mediation.[36] The study supports the idea that synesthesia is a semantic phenomenon – i.e., ideasthesia.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11 4H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v14a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h14a2 2 0 0 0 2-2v-7"></path><path d="M18.5 2.5a2.121 2.121 0 0 1 3 3L12 15l-4 1 1-4 9.5-9.5z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]" data-testid="conversation-turn-27" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative p-1 rounded-sm h-9 w-9 text-white flex items-center justify-center" style="background-color: rgb(171, 104, 255);

When linking the two, several connections emerge:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Brain Functioning and Concepts</strong>: Traditionally, cognitive science has often viewed concepts as emergent properties of intricate and specialized neural networks. However, in the theory of practopoiesis, concepts are fundamental to the adaptive principles of living systems. This inversion posits that the brain doesn't simply produce concepts as higher-order constructs; instead, conceptual processing is deeply ingrained in its operation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adaptive Systems and Practopoiesis</strong>: If concepts are foundational to brain function, it follows that our neural architectures are designed around these principles. This aligns with practopoiesis, where the brain's adaptive nature is structured around patterns of viable interaction with its environment. Ideasthesia, as a manifestation of this adaptability, suggests that our sensory experiences are intrinsically tied to our conceptual frameworks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Semantic Nature of Synesthesia</strong>: The research findings using magnetoencephalography bolster the argument that synesthesia isn't merely a sensory-sensory phenomenon, but rather a semantic one. The delay in color information when accessed via synesthesia aligns with the idea that conceptual processes mediate the sensory experiences. This supports ideasthesia's claim that it's the meaning or concept associated with a stimulus that elicits the sensory response.</p></li><li><p><strong>Challenging Classical Views</strong>: Both ideasthesia and practopoiesis challenge traditional perspectives in neuroscience and cognitive science. While older models emphasized a sensory-first approach, with concepts and meanings seen as derivatives, ideasthesia and practopoiesis propose that our sensory experiences are deeply entwined with, and perhaps even secondary to, our conceptual understandings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implications for Neural Adaptation</strong>: If practopoiesis emphasizes the brain's ability to create adaptive actions and ideasthesia underscores the role of concepts in shaping sensory experiences, it suggests that our neural pathways are continually adapting based on the interplay between conceptual understanding and sensory input. This dynamic dance could be crucial for understanding learning, memory, and the development of expertise.</p></li></ol><p>To sum it up, ideasthesia and practopoiesis together provide a compelling lens through which we can view the brain as an adaptive, concept-driven system. This perspective reshapes our understanding of cognition, perception, and the very nature of consciousness.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800" data-testid="conversation-turn-28" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="36" height="36" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div class="empty:hidden">It looks like I argued something this in an essay Semantic memory is all you need.

This resonates with Danko Nikolić's work on ideasthesia and practopoiesis. Here's how your argument dovetails with these concepts:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Concepts Before Imagery</strong>: If semantic memory serves as the foundation for visual and mental imagery, it aligns with the ideasthesia perspective. Here, concepts (semantic entities) induce sensory-like experiences. For those with aphantasia, the absence of visual imagery doesn't negate their ability to understand and engage with concepts. They just may not "visualize" these concepts in the same way others do.</p></li><li><p><strong>Voluntary Lucid Synesthesia</strong>: By framing mental imagery as a kind of "voluntary lucid synesthesia," you're emphasizing the active role individuals play in generating sensory-like experiences from concepts. This draws a parallel with practopoiesis, where the brain actively structures its operational coupling with the environment based on adaptive actions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Total Aphantasia and Concept Formation</strong>: Despite the absence of traditional mental imagery, individuals with total aphantasia can still conceptualize and understand their environment. This underscores the point that sensory experiences (like visual imagery) aren't necessary prerequisites for understanding. Semantic memory, with its vast repository of concepts and relationships, provides a rich substrate for comprehension.</p></li><li><p><strong>Redefining Perception and Cognition</strong>: If semantic memory is the cornerstone, then perception and cognition might be reconceptualized as the brain's efforts to map sensory experiences onto this semantic framework. Rather than sensory data driving conceptual understanding, it might be the other way around, with our semantic knowledge shaping and guiding our sensory experiences.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Role of Adaptation</strong>: Building upon the theory of practopoiesis, it can be postulated that the brain continuously adapts its semantic memory in response to environmental interactions. These adaptive changes, in turn, influence how concepts induce sensory-like experiences.</p></li></ol><p>Incorporating the perspectives of ideasthesia and practopoiesis into your argument lends added depth and nuance. By suggesting that semantic memory holds primacy in our cognitive architecture, you're not only challenging traditional views but also providing a fresh lens to explore the intricacies of perception, cognition, and consciousness.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800" data-testid="conversation-turn-30" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="36" height="36" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div class="empty:hidden">Charles Bonnet syndrome – visual disturbances and the experience of complex visual hallucinations in a blind person

Here's a brief explanation for each of the mentioned topics:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Charles Bonnet Syndrome</strong>:</p><ul><li>This is a medical condition where visually impaired individuals experience complex visual hallucinations, often vivid and detailed. Despite the intricate nature of these hallucinations, the affected individuals are aware that the visions aren't real. The syndrome is believed to result from the brain's attempt to "fill in" visual information in the absence of actual visual input.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Classificatory Disputes about Art</strong>:</p><ul><li>This revolves around disagreements regarding what should be deemed as "art". The definition and classification of art have been debated for centuries and change across cultures and eras. With the emergence of newer forms like digital art, performance art, and installations, the debate has become more complex. Central to the dispute is the challenge of defining the essential characteristics of art, which might include aesthetics, intent, context, and reception.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Consciousness</strong>:</p><ul><li>It refers to an individual's awareness of their surroundings, thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Consciousness remains one of the most elusive and debated topics in philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology. Many questions arise: What constitutes consciousness? How does the brain give rise to conscious experience? Can machines or other non-biological entities ever be conscious?</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explanatory Gap</strong>:</p><ul><li>This concept describes the challenge of explaining subjective experiences (qualia) in purely objective, physical, or structural terms. While we can detail the physical processes in the brain that correlate with consciousness, explaining how these processes give rise to subjective experience is difficult. For instance, we know the neural mechanics of color vision, but it's challenging to explain the subjective experience of "redness" in purely physical terms.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Your interests span a fascinating range of topics, each with its complexities and layers of understanding. If you'd like to delve deeper into any of these subjects or see how they might intersect, let me know!</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

Let's link the recently mentioned topics (Charles Bonnet Syndrome, Classificatory Disputes about Art, Consciousness, and Explanatory Gap) with your earlier themes of cognition, embodied perception, adaptive control systems, self-organization, and more.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Charles Bonnet Syndrome and Embodied Cognition</strong>:</p><ul><li>The syndrome illustrates the body's need for sensory input. In the absence of visual input, the brain, as an adaptive control system, attempts to "fill in the blanks" with hallucinations. This spontaneous generation of imagery reinforces the notion of perception-action coupling, where even in the absence of sensory stimuli, the brain remains active and generates perceptions.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Classificatory Disputes about Art and Enactive Approaches</strong>:</p><ul><li>What we classify as 'art' can be seen as a result of our active engagement and interpretation of the environment. Art, from an enactive perspective, is co-created between the artifact and the observer, much like how cognition is perceived in the enactive approach. Our perception of art is influenced by cultural, societal, and historical structures.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Consciousness, Practopoiesis, and Adaptive Systems</strong>:</p><ul><li>The emergence of consciousness can be thought of in terms of adaptive and self-organizing systems. Practopoiesis suggests that actions (or practices) shape cognitive structures, leading one to consider how conscious awareness is shaped by our adaptive responses to the environment.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Explanatory Gap, Ideasthesia, and Semantic Memory</strong>:</p><ul><li>The explanatory gap highlights the challenge of connecting objective brain processes with subjective experiences. Your essay's notion of semantic concepts forming the basis for visual and mental imagery aligns with Nikolić's idea of ideasthesia, where semantic triggers (rather than purely sensory ones) lead to sensory experiences. In essence, understanding consciousness might require understanding these semantic conceptualizations.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Historical Context and Art Classification</strong>:</p><ul><li>How we classify art has evolved over time and is deeply influenced by cultural, social, and historical contexts. Just as historical context is vital for understanding the emergence of cognition, it's also pivotal for understanding the evolving definitions of art.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Machine Autonomy and Consciousness</strong>:</p><ul><li>The challenge of recreating consciousness in machines brings forth the debate around the nature of consciousness. Is it an emergent property of complex systems, and if so, can it emerge from non-biological systems? The insights from practopoiesis and adaptive control systems could inform this quest.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Interdisciplinary Perspectives and the Explanatory Gap</strong>:</p><ul><li>Resolving the explanatory gap might require an interdisciplinary approach, borrowing insights from neuroscience, philosophy, cognitive science, and even quantum mechanics.</li></ul></li></ol><p>These connections illustrate the intertwined nature of these topics, emphasizing that understanding one often provides insights into another.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

Abstract
Patient NS is a 28year-old female who went blind in her early twenties as a result of S-cone syndrome, a degenerative retinal disorder. A few years after losing her vision, she started experiencing visual perceptions of her hands as she moved them and objects that came into contact with her hands. Over the course of a year, these cross-modal sensations evolved to become veridical visual experiences accurately representative of her hands, objects she touched, and to some degree, objects she could infer from her immediate surroundings. We argue that these experiences are distinct from mental imagery as they occurred automatically, remained consistent over time, and were proprioceptively mediated by her head position much like normal optical vision. Moreover, she could neither consciously force these visual experiences to occur without sensory inference nor prevent them from happening when haptically exploring an object. Her previous visual experiences contributed to a strong influence of top-down processing in her perceptions. Though individuals have previously been able to develop limited veridical acquired synesthesia following extensive practice over many years with the use of a special sensory device, none reported experiencing the richness of complexity or degree of top-down processing exhibited by NS. Thus, we posit that NS's case may represent a phenomenon beyond synesthesia altogether.

Let's connect it to the previous topics discussed:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Practopoiesis and Adaptation</strong>: This case could be seen as an example of the brain's adaptive capabilities. The brain has the ability to reorganize and adapt its functions in response to drastic changes in sensory input, in this case, the loss of vision. This adaptive capability might be seen in the context of practopoiesis, where the brain responds to changes by creating new action patterns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ideasthesia</strong>: NS's experience can be linked to ideasthesia. While synesthesia typically involves two sensory modalities (like hearing colors or seeing sounds), ideasthesia refers to the activation of a concept leading to a sensory experience. NS's tactile experiences led to visual perceptions, which might suggest that her haptic (touch) experiences activated concepts or memories of vision.</p></li><li><p><strong>Semantic Memory</strong>: The case highlights the importance of previously stored visual experiences or semantic memory. NS's previous visual memories likely played a significant role in her new visual experiences after going blind. This aligns with the idea you discussed earlier about semantic concepts serving as a foundation for visual and mental imagery.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consciousness and the Explanatory Gap</strong>: NS's case demonstrates the complexity of consciousness and the challenges of explaining how physical neuronal activity translates to subjective experiences.

Where is the mind within the brain? Transient selection of subnetworks by metabotropic receptors and G protein-gated ion channels
Danko Nikolić
Perhaps the most important question posed by brain research is: How the brain gives rise to the mind. To answer this question, we have primarily relied on the connectionist paradigm: The brain's entire knowledge and thinking skills are thought to be stored in the connections; and the mental operations are executed by network computations. I propose here an alternative paradigm: Our knowledge and skills are stored in metabotropic receptors (MRs) and the G protein-gated ion channels (GPGICs). Here, mental operations are assumed to be executed by the functions of MRs and GPGICs. As GPGICs have the capacity to close or open branches of dendritic trees and axon terminals, their states transiently re-route neural activity throughout the nervous system. First, MRs detect ligands that signal the need to activate GPGICs. Next, GPGICs transiently selects a subnetwork within the brain. The process of selecting this new subnetwork is what constitutes a mental operation -- be it in a form of directed attention, perception of a grandmother or making a decision. Synaptic connections and network computations play only a secondary role, supporting MRs and GPGICs. According to this new paradigm, the mind emerges within the brain as the function of MRs and GPGICs whose primary function is to continually select the pathways over which neural activity will be allowed to pass. It is argued that MRs and GPGICs solve the scaling problem of intelligence from which the connectionism paradigm suffers.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0 tabular-nums">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-xs" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11 4H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v14a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h14a2 2 0 0 0 2-2v-7"></path><path d="M18.5 2.5a2.121 2.121 0 0 1 3 3L12 15l-4 1 1-4 9.5-9.5z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]" data-testid="conversation-turn-39" style="--avatar-color:#AB68FF;"><div class="p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl }"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="relative p-1 rounded-sm h-9 w-9 text-white flex items-center justify-center" style="background-color: rgb(171, 104, 255);

The Brain Works Like a Resonance Chamber
FeaturedNeuroscienceOpen Neuroscience Articles·February 6, 2023
Summary: Using advanced neuroimaging techniques, researchers discovered distant brain regions oscillate together in time.

It’s been over 20 years since neuroimaging studies – using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a widely-used technology to capture live videos of brain activity – have been detecting brain-wide complex patterns of correlated brain activity that appear disrupted in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

These patterns form spontaneously, even at rest when no particular task is being performed, and have been detected not only in humans but also across mammals, including monkeys and rodents. 

Although such spatial patterns of correlated activation have been consistently detected across neuroimaging centers around the world, the nature of these correlations was not clear.

“We do not yet fully understand how the brain communicates over long distances. We know that distant areas exhibit signal correlations, and that they are implicated in brain function, but we do not completely understand their nature”, says Noam Shemesh, principal investigator of the Preclinical MRI Lab at the Champalimaud Foundation, in Lisbon, and senior author of a study published today in the journal Nature Communications. 

“In this study, we wanted to understand what lies underneath those correlations and investigate the mechanisms involved”, stresses Shemesh. 

A number of theoretical works had proposed that these patterns could be explained by standing waves (whose peaks and troughs do not move in space) resonating in the brain structure – that is, by waves analogous to the modes of vibration in musical instruments. But there was little experimental evidence to support this hypothesis due to the poor temporal resolution of fMRI, reaching only an image or two per second.

“If we could find that the spatial patterns oscillate, this would provide evidence supporting the resonance hypothesis” says Joana Cabral, first author of the study, from the Life and Health Sciences Research Institute of the University of Minho and a visiting scientist in Shemesh’s lab since 2019.

So what the team did was to speed up image acquisition, and they discovered that the signals in distant brain regions actually oscillate together in time.

“These oscillatory patterns look like a higher-dimensional analogue of resonance modes in musical instruments; they are akin to reverberations, to echoes inside the brain”, says Cabral.

“Our data show that the complex spatial patterns are a result of transiently and independently oscillating underlying modes, just like individual instruments participate in creating a more complex piece in an orchestra”, says Shemesh.

“The distinct modes, each contributing something to the overall picture at different time scales and different wavelengths, can be added up together, generating complex macroscopic patterns similar to the ones observed experimentally [see below]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that brain activity captured with fMRI is reconstructed as the superposition of standing waves”, he points out.

The new study thus strongly points to a key role for these resonant waves, or modes, in brain function. These resonant phenomena, the authors believe, are at the root of the coherent, coordinated brain activity that is needed for normal brain function as a whole. 

Ultrafast MRI

The researchers detected the resonant modes in rats in the resting state, which means the animals were not subjected to any specific external stimulus. Indeed, no tasks were needed, for as already mentioned, even when we (and mammals in general) are doing nothing in particular, our brains continue to generate spontaneous activity patterns that can be captured by fMRI.

To visualise the oscillations, the researchers created “videos” of activity using the  potent ultrahigh-field experimental MRI scanner in Shemesh’s lab and performed ultrafast experiments developed some time ago by that lab for other purposes.

“Noam and I met in 2019, and we decided to obtain recordings of brain activity at the maximum temporal resolution we could achieve in the 9.4 Tesla scanner at his lab”, recalls Cabral. “Noam designed the experiments, Francisca Fernandes [the third author of the study] performed them, and I did the data analysis and the visualisation.

Noam managed to achieve a temporal resolution of 26 images per second, and thus obtained 16,000 images per 10 minute scan (instead of 600 images at the typical resolution of one image per second).”

Like waves in the ocean

“When we first saw the videos of the recorded brain activity, we saw clear waves of activity, like waves in the ocean, propagating in complex patterns within the cortex and the striatum [a subcortical region of the forebrain]”, says Cabral.

“And we found that the signals could be described by the superposition of a small number of macroscopic stationary waves, or resonant modes, oscillating in time. Notably, each standing wave was found to cover extended areas of the brain, with peaks distributed in distinct cortical and subcortical structures, forming functional networks.”



The researchers experimented with rats in three different conditions: sedated, lightly anesthetised and deeply anesthetised. (In fact, the animals were lightly sedated in the resting state, to avoid any discomfort to them.) “The spatial configuration of these stationary waves was very consistent across rats scanned in the same condition”, Cabral points out. 

Shemesh adds: “We showed that brain functional networks are driven by resonance phenomena. This explains the correlations that are otherwise observed when you do slow imaging. Long-range brain interactions are governed by a ‘flow’ of information that is oscillatory and repetitive.”

Let's break down some key connections:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Correlated Brain Activity &amp; Resonance</strong>: Both articles touch on the idea that the brain operates based on patterns that are more intricate than just simple neural connectivity. The brain's long-range interactions are oscillatory and repetitive, much like resonant waves in musical instruments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spatial Patterns of Activation</strong>: In both the ideasthesia topic and the resonance chamber theory, there's an emphasis on the significance of spatial patterns. In the case of ideasthesia, the brain's semantic trigger can activate a sensory experience. Similarly, resonance chambers suggest that these patterns of brain activity oscillate together, indicating a certain level of spatial organization and coordination.</p></li><li><p><strong>Temporal Aspects</strong>: Just as Danko Nikolić's proposal emphasizes the transient nature of mental operations through the selection of subnetworks, the resonance chamber study's use of ultrafast MRI highlights the oscillatory patterns and their timely coordination.</p></li><li><p><strong>Underlying Mechanisms</strong>: While Nikolić points towards metabotropic receptors as the basis for cognitive processes, the resonance theory emphasizes the brain's underlying standing waves as the foundation for coordinated brain activity. Both theories move away from traditional neural connectivity models and propose more intricate, dynamic mechanisms of brain operation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integration of Diverse Elements</strong>: Both discussions touch on the idea of multiple elements or modes working together to produce a more complex outcome. In the resonance chamber theory, distinct modes or waves contribute to a complex macroscopic pattern, similar to individual instruments in an orchestra. Similarly, in the ideasthesia discussion, the activation of semantic concepts triggers sensory experiences, demonstrating the integration of diverse cognitive elements.</p></li></ol><p>By intertwining these concepts, "Metabotropic Cognition" can be seen as a theoretical exploration into how the brain's intricate mechanisms, from metabotropic receptors to resonant patterns of activity, contribute to our understanding of cognition, perception, and consciousness. The title captures the essence of a deep dive into the evolving theories of brain function and cognition, challenging traditional neural connectivity models and offering fresh perspectives.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

comprehension of the brain and its intricate processes has been shaped over the years by a multitude of theories, each with its own nuances and areas of focus. Yet, with every new discovery, it becomes clear that our brain is far more multifaceted than we once believed. In this essay, we delve into an emerging understanding of cognition, drawing from concepts like ideasthesia, the resonance chamber theory of the brain, and the role of metabotropic receptors in shaping our thoughts and experiences. Moreover, we'll attempt to weave a thread through these notions, connecting them with other related topics such as Charles Bonnet Syndrome, art classification disputes, and the nature of consciousness.</p><p><strong>1. Ideasthesia and the Power of Semantics:</strong></p><p>The term 'ideasthesia' refers to the phenomenon where the activation of a concept or idea leads to a sensory experience. This runs counter to the traditional understanding of synesthesia, where a sensory input activates another sensory modality. Ideasthesia implies that our concepts and ideas might be more integral to our sensory experiences than we initially thought.</p><p>Moreover, this idea resonates with theories suggesting that semantic memories serve as a foundation for visual and mental imagery, making it possible for individuals with conditions like total aphantasia to form concepts. It's a fascinating testament to the power of the mind and its adaptability.</p><p><strong>2. The Brain as a Resonance Chamber:</strong></p><p>Recent research has brought to light the possibility that the brain operates much like a resonance chamber. Advanced neuroimaging has revealed that distant brain regions oscillate in unison, forming patterns reminiscent of resonant waves in musical instruments. These patterns are spontaneous, complex, and pervasive across mammals, suggesting an underlying universality in how brains function.</p><p>This idea of resonance gives an added dimension to our understanding of consciousness and the mysterious 'explanatory gap'. If our brain operates on resonant frequencies, perhaps our conscious experiences are the harmonious results of these oscillations.</p><p><strong>3. Metabotropic Receptors and the Dynamics of Thought:</strong></p><p>A significant departure from traditional connectionist paradigms, Danko Nikolić's proposal suggests that our knowledge and cognitive abilities reside in metabotropic receptors (MRs) and G protein-gated ion channels (GPGICs). According to this paradigm, the mind emerges within the brain due to the continual selection of pathways allowed by these receptors and channels. This theory, if validated, could significantly shift our understanding of cognition, memory, and even consciousness itself.</p><p><strong>Connecting the Dots:</strong></p><p>All these concepts are not isolated islands of thought. Charles Bonnet Syndrome, for instance, where blind individuals experience visual hallucinations, might be an extreme manifestation of ideasthesia. Here, the lack of visual input could potentially amplify the power of concepts to induce vivid visual experiences.</p><p>Similarly, disputes in art classification highlight the subjective nature of sensory experiences. What one perceives as art, another might not, suggesting that our semantic understanding of 'art' could be influencing our sensory perception, a la ideasthesia.</p><p>Finally, the 'explanatory gap', which deals with our inability to describe conscious experiences in solely physical terms, might find some answers in the resonance chamber theory and the metabotropic cognition paradigm.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>"Metabotropic Cognition" serves as a vanguard in our exploration of the brain and its workings. By integrating diverse theories, from the role of semantic concepts in sensory experiences to the brain's resonant oscillations, we edge closer to unraveling the tapestry of consciousness and understanding the true essence of cognition.
